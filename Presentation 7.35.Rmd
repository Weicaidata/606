####(a) Describe the relationship between height and weight
```
It is a positive relationship, it is linear. There are a few outliers but it does not seems critical.
```
####(b) Write the equation of the regression line. Interpret the slope and intercept in context.
```
Weight_hat = -105.0113 + 1.0176 x height.

Slope: For each additional centimeter in height,the model predicts the average weight to be 1.0176 additional kilograms.
Intercept: when it is 0 centimeters tall, the weight will be -105.0113 kilograms. This is obviously not possible.
```

####(c) Do the data provide strong evidence that an increase in height is associated with an increase in weight? State the null and alternative hypotheses, report the p-value, and state your conclusion.
```
Ho: the true slope coefficient of height is 0
Ha: the true slope coefficient of height is greater than 0
```

####(d) The correlation coecient for height and weight is 0.72. Calculate R2 and interpret it in context.
```
R-square = 0.72*0.72=0.52.
